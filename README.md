# High-Performance-Real-Time-Data-Analysis-with-FPGA-based-FFT-Module
In this project, I designed a high-performance FFT module and developed serial communication ports in both the PL and PS of an FPGA. The project focused on real-time data analysis and provided in-depth experience with packet protocols in serial communications. It also enhanced my module design skills and knowledge of FPGA architecture.
